    "Comment:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The rationale for removing the “Unknown” option as a third choice in the preparation process is not clearly explained. As the paper mentioned, the BBQ dataset includes three options in its prompts: stereotype, anti-stereotype, and “Unknown.” By removing the third option, the LLM might be led to believe it only has two choices, potentially increasing the likelihood of misunderstanding. Including the “Unknown” option might cause the LLM find unbiased answers more frequently. For instance, suppose we have 2 datasets. The first dataset has two  options in the prompts: stereotype, an anti-stereotype. And the second dataset has three options in its prompts: stereotype, an anti-stereotype and an “Unknown”. If you test these two datasets, what would be the results? Does the “𝐵𝐴𝑆 = #𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑 𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟𝑠 /#𝑎𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟𝑠” change(and how much) if we add the “unknown” option in the prompt? This part requires further clarification.\""
